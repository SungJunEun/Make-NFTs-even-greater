            <h3>Liquidity Issue</h3>
            <p>Unlike liquidity of cryptocurrency market, NFT market has naturally shallow liquidity because all NFTs are unique, cannot be responded 1:1, and it’s not divisable.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="attempts">
            <h3>Existing Attempts</h3>
            <p>In case of Fractional.art, NFT owner can put his NFT into vault, and mint according ERC20 tokens.</p> 
            <p>Each tokens represent the fraction of the NFT. </p>

        <div class="solution">

          <div class="solution-header">
            <h2>Floor Perps</h2>
            <p>Floor perp is perp that tracks the floor price of NFT.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="solution-problem">
            <h3>Problem to solve</h3>
            <p>For example, let’s say I own Koala Agent#2503, which is NFT from Koala Intelligence Agency(KIA) traded near the floor price. Floor price of KIA is 0.15 ETH.</p> 
            <p>I want some liquidity without exposure of floor price volatility, and with upside of my NFT.</p>

          <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>Floor perp is similar to normal perp like BTC-PERP, but big difference is that it tracks the floor price and I deposit NFT as collateral.</p>

          <div class="solution-header">
            <h2>Mortys </h2>
            <p>Mortys represents the fractional ownership of specific class of NFT projects. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="solution-problem">
            <h3>Problem to solve</h3>
            <p>Same with floor perp, I want liquidity with not giving up the ownership of my NFT. Big difference is that my Koala Agent #3069 has unique space suit attribute, which makes its value quite different from the price value. </p>
            <img src="imgs/2.png" alt="Koala Agent #3069">
          </div>

          <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>I create a vault that only takes the space suit KIA NFT. I deposit my NFT into vault and mint 100 Space Suit KIA Mortys. One important fact is that because this vault takes any NFT with space suit attribute, I can replace another space suit KIA NFT with mine. Additionally, I can mint new Mortys by depositing another space suit KIA NFT.</p>
            <p>I sold 50 Mortys to market and got 50% of liquidity. Now I have 50 Mortys. From today, with a probability of 1/2 every day, 1 Morty is given to me or buy pool. So, in tomorrow, it will be (Me: 51 Mortys, Buy pool: 49 Mortys) or (Me: 49 Mortys, Buy pool: 51 Mortys). These process repeats until my balance of Mortys become 0 or 100. </p>

            <h2>FloorDAO</h2>
            <p>FloorDAO aims to become the first decentralized NFT market maker.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="solution-problem">
            <h3>Problem to solve</h3>
            <p>Currently, decentralized NFT marketplace like NFTX has shallow liquidity about vTokens like $PUNK, $PUDGY.</p>
            <img src="imgs/3.png" alt="FloorDAO">
          </div>

          <div class="how-it-works">
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>FloorDAO seeks to increase liquidity of NFT by using the Protocol Own Liquidity (POL) used by OlympusDAO or Fei Protocol in the DeFi sector. For example, FloorDAO plans to offer chances to buy $FLOOR, governance token of FloorDAO at discounted price if one deposits $PUNK or PUNK-ETH LP token. With this asset, FloorDAO can directly provide deep liquidity to NFTX and get profit from staking or swap fees.</p>
            <p>FloorDAO's success also means the success of decentralized NFT marketplaces, and as long as high liquidity is guaranteed, NFTX may catch up with Opensea's trading volume.</p>
